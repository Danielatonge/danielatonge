## About Me

I love using my superpower (building software) in any way that adds value.

+ Recent software engineering graduate who has tried quite a number of disciplines in the software field including;
  - Front-end - Vue (Nuxt), React (Next).
  - Mobile - React Native, Flutter.
  - Back-end - Python, Express, Nestjs.
  - DevOps - Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Ansible, Github actions.
  - Research - Wrote scientific research papers on “Digital Image Forgery” and “Minimising Energy Consumption in Computer Devices”. Implemented “A static type checker for Jolie Programming Language”.
  - Design - Figma.

+ When not occupied with university work, I work on small projects. My current project is moolax.tech a payment system powered by blockchain and my last project was the unstoppable universe. It tries to address key issues faced by organizations and institutions (e.g finding the most believable employees/instructors to assign to a given task/course).

+ From a tender age, I have been fascinated by how software affects our daily lives. Since then, my mission has been to build and contribute to software and systems that add value to people's everyday lives.

+ Understanding I still have a long journey ahead and an infinite list of things to learn in this beautiful field of software engineering. I will love to network with teams and individuals who promote innovation and failure.

+ As much as I love learning, I also enjoy teaching and demystifying concepts. I have held teaching roles on several occasions
